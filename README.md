# squad-models

Deep Learning Models for Machine Reading Comprehension
For the final project in CS224N : Natural Language Processing, 2017 offering.

- For the purpose of cleanliness, make a new folder for each model we implement, which includes only the 3 python files (or a few more, if the qa\*.py depends on another source file.)

- To run the model, download these 3 files and replace them in the assignment directory.

- Please use tensorflow-gpu 1.0.0 for implementation, which has slightly different syntax from 0.12.1 version.

- In general case, we would work on separate models, unless we need to work on the same model at the same time.

Have fun!

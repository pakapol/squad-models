# squad-models

Deep Learning Models for Machine Reading Comprehension, to be tested on SQuAD dataset.

For the final project in CS224N : Natural Language Processing, 2017 offering.

- For the purpose of cleanliness, **make a new folder for each model we implement**, which includes only the 3 python files (or a few more, if the qa\*.py depends on other source files.)

- To run the model, download these **4 python files** and replace them in the assignment directory.

- Use tensorflow-gpu 1.0.0 for implementation. It has slightly different syntax from 0.12.1 version.

- In general case, we would work on separate models at a time, unless we do need to work on the same model at the same time.

Have fun!
